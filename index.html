<section id="abstract">
  <p>This document presents an architecture and attendant components that together enable
  interaction between the [[Web-Protocol-Tests]] framework, the [[testharness.js]] library that is part of that
  framework, and the Accessibility API on any platform.  It is loosely based upon work done in the ARIA Working Group
  and its ancestor Protocols and Formats Working Group, but takes its inspriation from the way that the various Accessibility
  API Mapping specifications provide for a consistent way to expose and interrogate aspects of essentially any window
  on any platform.</p>
</section>
<section id="sotd">
  <p>This is a very drafty document intended to be a place to capture the definition of the
  architecture as it is developed. In particular, the contents of <a
    href="#terminology">Terminology</a> are in a state of flux, and the content of
  the <a href="#teststatements">Testable Statements</a> is still being refined on
  a per-platform basis.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Historically, testing of aspects of the web platform that are
  outside of the user agent have been very challenging.  Such
  testing requires specialized test rigs, platform unique
  instrumentation, etc.  Often the use of such tooling is helpful,
  but still does not enable fully automated testing of those aspects
  in a way that is portable or scales well.  In these situations,
  manual testing has been required. Previous testing of the ARIA
  Specification(s) and related <a>accessibility api mappings</a>
  fell into this category.</p>
  <p>This specification defines a mechanism whereby any platform
  that supports Web Platform Accessibility and exposes that support
  through a platform <a>Accessibility API</a> can be tested
  automatically.  In addition, it defines a simplified declarative
  grammar that can be used to define the tests themselves &emdash;
  thereby simplifying the overall task of writing the tests in the
  first place.
  </p>

  <p>This document starts out describing the way testing at the W3C
  operates for most of the web platform, then illustrates the way in
  which it is extended through the facilities defined herein.  After
  that it provides specifications for each of the components of the
  system and their interactions with one another.  Finally, it
  discusses some ways in which the system could be extended in the
  future to further ease test development and make the testing more
  thorough.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
  <p>In <a>WPT</a> a <dfn>parent window</dfn> controls
  the selection of tests, and then opens a
  <dfn data-lt='test window'>child window</dfn> to execute the
  selected tests.  That child window uses a Javascript library to control test
  sequencing, reporting, management if windows, etc.  For most tests, that model looks
  something like this:</p>
  <img style="width: 95%; align: center" src="wpt-dialog.svg" alt="Simple WPT Dialog Example">
  <p>Through this document and the tools that it defines,
  ARIA testing extends this model by connecting the child window to an
  <a>ATTA</a> <abbr title="Accessible Technology Test Adapter">ATTA</abbr> through another
  Javascript library and a well defined protocol and set of messages. The
  diagram below shows this expansion.</p>
  <img style="width: 95%; align: center" src="dialog.svg" alt="WPT Dialog with ATTA">
</section>
<section id="teststatements">
  <h2>Testable Statements</h2>
  <p>A testable statement is a simple assertion about the behavior of a system
  that, when examined, should evaluate to true.  In the case of ARIA
  specifications, the testable statements are maintained in various wikis.
  They include this assertion, and also include
  supporting information to inform the test system which aspects of the underlying
  systems need to be examined to evaluate the assertion.</p>
  <p class="note">It is possible that in some environments an ATTA will
  not be be available. Consequently, additional properties of the
  Testable Statement can help a manual tester understand how to
  perform a similar test without ATTA assistance.  Examples include
  the <code>URL</code> and <code>description</code> properties
  mentioned below.</p>
  <p>Consider the following example:</p>
  <pre class="example">
== Testable Statements for ARIA 1.1 features ==

SpecURL:  https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria11

=== gridcell ===

==== Description ====

When an element has a role with a value of 'grid', its aria-rowcount
and aria-colcount attributes descibe the dimensions of the grid
represented by that element and its contents.

Reference: #some_id

&lt;pre&gt;
If given
  &lt;div role='grid' id='test' aria-rowcount='3' aria-colcount='2'&gt;
   &lt;div role='row'&gt;
      &lt;span role='gridcell'&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;hello&lt;/button&gt;
     &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
then role: grid, celcount: 2, rowcount: 3
&lt;/pre&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>This example presents a description of the test's purpose, a
  reference to the section of the specification that defines the
  behavior under test, and an HTML fragment and conditions that should be met.
  Beyond this, the testable statement needs to show how these conditions are
  evaluated through each defined <a>API mapping</a>. An example of one such would be:</p>
  <pre class="example">
  |-
  |rowspan=4|ATK
  |property
  |role
  |is
  |ROLE_TABLE
  |-
  |property
  |objectAttributes
  |contains
  |xml-roles:grid
  |-
  |property
  |interfaces
  |contains
  |Table
  |-
  |property
  |interface
  |contains
  |Selection
  </pre>

  <p>This is an example of a MediaWiki-style table fragment.  In this case it is a
  series of rows and columns that describe the various items that the ATK ATTA
  will evaluate.  The WPT ARIA test generator tool parse tables like this and
  generates an HTML file containing a JSON representation of the data structured
  in such a way that it can be processed by the <a>ATTA Communication Module</a>.
  The JSON for the examples above looks like:</p>

  <pre class="example">
    { "title": 'grid',
      "reference": 'https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria11#some_id',
      "description": "When an element has a role with a value of 'grid', its aria-rowcount and aria-colcount attributes descibe the dimensions of the grid represented by that element and its contents.",

             "ATK" : [

                   "property"
                   "role",
                   "is",
                   "ROLE_TABLE"
                ],
                [
                   "property"
                   "objectAttributes",
                   "contains",
                   "xml-roles:grid"
                ],
                [
                   "property"
                   "objectAttributes",
                   "contains",
                   "rowcount:3:,
                ],
                [
                   "property"
                   "objectAttributes",
                   "contains",
                   "colcount:2:,
                ],
                [

                   "interfaces",
                   "contains",
                   "Table"

                ]
             ],
             ....
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  </pre>

  <p>The system with automatically generate [[WPT]] compatible test
  cases that are formatted as defined in this specification.  Test
  cases can also be written by hand.  Examples and a template are
  available in the <code>wai-aria/tools</code> directory of the WPT
  github repository.</p>

  <p class="note">
  The architecture of this system allows for multiple "steps" per
  test (see <a>Test Steps</a>).  The current syntax structure for
  Testable Statements does not allow for the expression of
  multiple "steps". It is possible that this will be added in the
  future.</p>

  <p class="note">
  In the future, it is possible that that the detailed per-platform
  API assertions will be automatically created from a basic
  assertion by applying the rules from the <a>Accessibility API Mapping</a>
  document associated with each specification.   See <a>Future
      Plans</a> for more information.

  <section id="S_assertions">
    <h3>Assertions</h3>
    <p>Each <a>platform accessibility API</a> has unique facilities.  The per-platform
    API assertion <i>structure</i> is identical, but the contents are necessarily different.  The
    general structure is:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Test Class</dt>
      <dd>The class of thing being tested.  Examples include a <i>relation</i>, <i>property</i>, <i>result</i> (of
      a method call), or <i>event</i>.  As a special case, a Test Class of <code>TBD</code> is a
      placeholder that means
      the assertions are "to be determined".  An ATTA that sees a
      Test Class of <code>TBD</code> SHOULD respond with a result of "FAIL" and a message that includes
      sufficient detail about the accessibility tree associated with the <code>element</code> in
      question that a test developer could review that information and use it to develop the correct
      assertions for a given platform.</dd>
      <dt>Test Type</dt>
      <dd>The <i>type</i> within the <i>Test Class</i>.  Examples include <i>role</i>, <i>name</i>,
      <i>subrole</i>, etc.</dd>
      <dt>Assertion Type</dt>
      <dd>A <i>verb</i> that indicates how the assertion should be evaluated.  These include
      <code>exists</code>,
      <code>is</code>,
      <code>isNot</code>,
      <code>contains</code>,
      <code>doesNotContain</code>,
      <code>isType</code>, and
      <code>isAny</code>.</dd>
      <dt>Value</dt>
      <dd>A value (or value list) against which to evaluate using ASSERTION TYPE. If there are
      multiple values, they are enclosed in brackets and separated with commas and optional whitespace (e.g., [value1, value2,
      value3]).  When the Assertion Type of <i>exists</i> is used, legal values are <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>.
      <p class='note'>At this time commas embedded in values within a value list are NOT supported.</p></dd>

    <h3>Protocol</h3>
    <p>The ATTA protocol is a simple command/response protocol relying upon
    HTTP.  By default, an ATTA SHOULD listen on port 4119 (A11Y).  It is NOT
    RESTful.  Instead, it uses JSON messages and wraps them in a simple
    request where the path portion indicates that command. A typical
    conversation between the ATTA and the Framework might look like this:</p>

    aspects of a specific platform's implementation.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>Accessibility Subtree</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>An <a>accessible object</a> in the <a>accessibility tree</a> and its descendants in that tree. It does not include objects which have relationships other than parent-child in that tree. For example, it does not include objects linked via <pref>aria-flowto</pref> unless those objects are also descendants in the <a>accessibility tree</a>.</p>

    <dt><dfn>Accessibility Tree</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Tree of <a class="termref" data-lt="accessible object">accessible objects</a> that represents the structure of the user interface (UI). Each node in the accessibility tree represents an element in the <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> as exposed through the <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a>; for example, a push button, a check box, or container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Accessible Description</dfn></dt>

    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="accessible names">Accessible Name</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The accessible name is the name of a user interface element. Each platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr></a> provides the accessible name property. The value of the accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an icon) property of the user interface element.  See related <a>accessible description</a>.</p>
    <p>A simple use for the accessible name property may be illustrated by an &quot;OK&quot; button. The text &quot;OK&quot; is the accessible name. When the button receives focus, assistive technologies may concatenate the platform's role description with the accessible name. For example, a screen reader may speak &quot;push-button OK&quot; or &quot;OK button&quot;. The order of concatenation and specifics of the role description (e.g., &quot;button&quot;, &quot;push-button&quot;, &quot;clickable button&quot;) are determined by platform <a class="termref" data-lt="accessibility api">accessibility API</a>s or <a>assistive technologies</a>.</p>

In the context of markup languages (e.g., HTML and SVG) in general, and of WAI-ARIA in particular, markup <a class="termref" data-lt="element">elements</a> and their <a class="termref" data-lt="attribute">attributes</a> are represented as accessible objects.  </p>

    <dt><dfn>Activation behavior</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The action taken when an <a>event</a>, typically initiated by users through an input device, causes an element to fulfill a defined role. The role may be defined for that element by the host language, or by author-defined variables, or both. The role for any given element may be a generic action, or may be unique to that element. For example, the activation behavior of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element shall be to cause the user agent to traverse the link specified in the <code>href</code> attribute, with the further optional parameter of specifying the browsing context for the traversal (such as the current window or tab, a named window, or a new window); the activation behavior of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code> attribute value <code>submit</code> shall be to send the values of the form elements to an author-defined <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRI</abbr> by the author-defined <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> method.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="live regions">Live Region</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Live regions are perceivable regions of a web page that are typically updated as a result of an external event when user focus may be elsewhere. These regions are not always updated as a result of a user interaction. This practice has become commonplace with the growing use of Ajax. Examples of live regions include a chat log, stock ticker, or a sport scoring section that updates periodically to reflect game statistics. Since these asynchronous areas are expected to update outside the user's area of focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers have either been unaware of their existence or unable to process them for the user. WAI-ARIA has provided a collection of properties that allow the author to identify these live regions and process them: aria-live, aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy. Pre-defined live region roles are listed in the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#chobet">Choosing Between Special Case Live Regions</a></cite> ([[WAI-ARIA-PRACTICES]], Section 5.3).</p>
