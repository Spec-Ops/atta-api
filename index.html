  <p>This document presents an architecture and attendant components that together enable
  interaction between the [[Web-Protocol-Tests]] framework, the [[testharness.js]] library that is part of that
  framework, and the Accessibility API on any platform.  It is loosely based upon work done in the ARIA Working Group
  and its ancestor Protocols and Formats Working Group, but takes its inspriation from the way that the various Accessibility
  API Mapping specifications provide for a consistent way to expose and interrogate aspects of essentially any window
  on any platform.</p>
</section>
<section id="sotd">
  <p>This is a very drafty document intended to be a place to capture the definition of the
  architecture as it is developed. In particular, the contents of <a
    href="#terminology">Terminology</a> are in a state of flux, and the content of
  the <a href="#teststatements">Testable Statements</a> is still being refined on
  a per-platform basis.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<section>
  <h2>Theory of Operation</h2>
  <p>In <a>WPT</a> a parent window controls
  the selection of tests, and then opens a child window to execute the
  selected tests.  That child window uses a Javascript library to control test
  sequencing, reporting, management if windows, etc.  For most tests, that model looks
  something like this:</p>
  <img style="width: 95%; align: center" src="wpt-dialog.svg" alt="Simple WPT Dialog Example">
  <p>Through this document and the tools that it defines,
  ARIA testing extends this model by connecting the child window to an
  <a>ATTA</a> <abbr title="Accessible Technology Test Adapter">ATTA</abbr> through another
  Javascript library and a well defined protocol and set of messages. The
  diagram below shows this expansion.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Simple Tests</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>Simple Test</dfn> is a test in which the ATTA only needs to interrogate
    the state of various Accessible Technology roles, states, properties, methods, or
    events on the platform.  Each platform has its own collection of these
    that are 1G

  <section>
    <h3>Protocol</h3>
    <p>The ATTA protocol is a simple command/response protocol relying upon
    HTTP.  By default, an ATTA SHOULD listen on port 4119 (A11Y).  It is NOT
    RESTful.  Instead, it uses JSON messages and wraps them in a simple
    request where the path portion indicates that command. A typical
    conversation between the ATTA and the Framework might look like this:</p>

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <dl class="termlist">
    <dt><dfn><abbr title="Accessible Technology Test Adapter">ATTA</abbr></dfn>
    <dd>The ATTA is a tool that acts as the interface between the <a>WPT</a>
    <a>child window</a> and the <a>platform accessibility API</a>.  It
    interprets requirements defined in <a>testable statements</a> and
    evaluates them against the characteristics of the <a>child window</a> to
    help evaluate the conformance of the <a>platform accessibility API</a> to
    the requirements in related W3C Recommendations.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>child window</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A window opened by the WPT test runner in which test cases are loaded
    and executed.</dd>
    <dt><dfn><abbr title="Web Platform Tests">WPT</abbr></dfn></dt>
    <dd>The collection of tests and tools that the W3C relies upon to exercise
    the Web Platform (where that is the collection of technologies that
    comprise the World Wide Web).</dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="testable statement|testable statements">Testable
      Statement</dfn></dt>
    <dd>A simple (hopefully atomic) definition about the behavior of some
    component. In the context of this system, a testable statement includes
    information about what behaviors should or should not be attached to an
    element with a unique ID within the <a>child window</a>.</dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="platform accessibility api|accessibility api|accessibility apis">Accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Operating systems and other platforms provide a set of interfaces that expose information about <a class="termref" data-lt="object">objects</a> and <a class="termref" data-lt="event">events</a> to <a>assistive technologies</a>. Assistive technologies use these interfaces to get information about and interact with those <a class="termref" data-lt="widget">widgets</a>. Examples of accessibility APIs are <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms697270(VS.85).aspx">Microsoft Active Accessibility</a> [[MSAA]], <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee684013%28VS.85%29.aspx">Microsoft User Interface Automation</a> [[UI-AUTOMATION]], <abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> with <cite><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd561898(v=vs.85).aspx"><abbr title="User Interface Automation">UIA</abbr> Express</a></cite> [[UIA-EXPRESS]], the

    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Accessibility Subtree</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>An <a>accessible object</a> in the <a>accessibility tree</a> and its descendants in that tree. It does not include objects which have relationships other than parent-child in that tree. For example, it does not include objects linked via <pref>aria-flowto</pref> unless those objects are also descendants in the <a>accessibility tree</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Accessibility Tree</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Tree of <a class="termref" data-lt="accessible object">accessible objects</a> that represents the structure of the user interface (UI). Each node in the accessibility tree represents an element in the <abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr> as exposed through the <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a>; for example, a push button, a check box, or container.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Accessible Description</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>An accessible description provides additional information, related to an interface element, that complements the <a>accessible name</a>. The accessible description might or might not be visually perceivable. </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="accessible names">Accessible Name</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The accessible name is the name of a user interface element. Each platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr></a> provides the accessible name property. The value of the accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an icon) property of the user interface element.  See related <a>accessible description</a>.</p>
    <p>A simple use for the accessible name property may be illustrated by an &quot;OK&quot; button. The text &quot;OK&quot; is the accessible name. When the button receives focus, assistive technologies may concatenate the platform's role description with the accessible name. For example, a screen reader may speak &quot;push-button OK&quot; or &quot;OK button&quot;. The order of concatenation and specifics of the role description (e.g., &quot;button&quot;, &quot;push-button&quot;, &quot;clickable button&quot;) are determined by platform <a class="termref" data-lt="accessibility api">accessibility API</a>s or <a>assistive technologies</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="accessible objects">Accessible object</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A <a>node</a> in the <a>accessibility tree</a> of a platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr></a>. Accessible objects expose various <a class="termref" data-lt="state">states</a>, <a class="termref" data-lt="property">properties</a>, and <a class="termref" data-lt="event">events</a> for use by <a>assistive technologies</a>.  In the context of markup languages (e.g., HTML and SVG) in general, and of WAI-ARIA in particular, markup <a class="termref" data-lt="element">elements</a> and their <a class="termref" data-lt="attribute">attributes</a> are represented as accessible objects.  </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Activation behavior</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The action taken when an <a>event</a>, typically initiated by users through an input device, causes an element to fulfill a defined role. The role may be defined for that element by the host language, or by author-defined variables, or both. The role for any given element may be a generic action, or may be unique to that element. For example, the activation behavior of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element shall be to cause the user agent to traverse the link specified in the <code>href</code> attribute, with the further optional parameter of specifying the browsing context for the traversal (such as the current window or tab, a named window, or a new window); the activation behavior of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the <code>type</code> attribute value <code>submit</code> shall be to send the values of the form elements to an author-defined <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRI</abbr> by the author-defined <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> method.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="assistive technology">Assistive Technologies</dfn></dt>
    <dd><p>Hardware and/or software that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>relies on services provided by a <a>user agent</a> to retrieve and render Web content </li>
      <li>works with a user agent or web content itself through the use of APIs, and</li>
      <li>provides services beyond those offered by the user agent to facilitate user interaction with web content by people with disabilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This definition may differ from that used in other documents.</p>
    <p>Examples of assistive technologies that are important in the context
    of this document include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>screen magnifiers, which are used to enlarge and improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;</li>
      <li>screen readers, which are most-often used to convey information through synthesized speech or a refreshable Braille display;</li>
      <li>text-to-speech software, which is used to convert text into synthetic speech;</li>
      <li>speech recognition software, which is used to allow spoken control and dictation;</li>
      <li>alternate input technologies (including head pointers, on-screen keyboards, single switches, and sip/puff devices), which are used to simulate the keyboard;</li>
      <li>alternate pointing devices, which are used to simulate mouse pointing and clicking.</li>

    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="live regions">Live Region</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Live regions are perceivable regions of a web page that are typically updated as a result of an external event when user focus may be elsewhere. These regions are not always updated as a result of a user interaction. This practice has become commonplace with the growing use of Ajax. Examples of live regions include a chat log, stock ticker, or a sport scoring section that updates periodically to reflect game statistics. Since these asynchronous areas are expected to update outside the user's area of focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers have either been unaware of their existence or unable to process them for the user. WAI-ARIA has provided a collection of properties that allow the author to identify these live regions and process them: aria-live, aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy. Pre-defined live region roles are listed in the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#chobet">Choosing Between Special Case Live Regions</a></cite> ([[WAI-ARIA-PRACTICES]], Section 5.3).</p>

    <p> The primary element containing non-metadata content. In many languages, this is  the document element but in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, it is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="semantic|semantically">Semantics</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The meaning of something as understood by a human, defined in a way that computers can process a representation of an <a>object</a>, such as <a class="termref" data-lt="element">elements</a> and <a class="termref" data-lt="attribute">attributes</a>, and reliably represent the object in a way that various humans will achieve a mutually consistent understanding of the object.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn data-lt="states">State</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A state is a dynamic <a class="termref" href="#dfn-property">property</a> expressing characteristics of an <a>object</a> that may change in response to user action or automated processes. States do not affect the essential nature of the object, but represent data associated with the object or user interaction possibilities. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#statevsprop">clarification of states versus properties</a>.</p>

    <dt><dfn>Sub-document</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Any document created from a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> or similar mechanism. A sub-document may contain a document, an application or any widget such as a calendar pulled in from another server. In the <a>accessibility tree</a> there are two <a class="termref" data-lt="accessible object">accessible objects</a> for this situation&mdash;one represents the <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element in the parent document, which parents a single <a>accessible object</a> child representing the spawned document contents.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Target Element</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>An element specified in a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> relation. For example, in <code> &lt;div aria-controls=”elem1”&gt;</code>, where <code>“elem1”</code> is the ID for the target element.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Taxonomy</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A hierarchical definition of how the characteristics of various <a class="termref" data-lt="class">classes</a> relate to each other, in which classes inherit the properties of superclasses in the hierarchy. A taxonomy can comprise part of the formal definition of an <a>ontology</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>Text node</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Type of <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> <a class="termref" data-lt="node">node</a> that represents the textual content of an <a class="termref">attribute</a> or an <a class="termref">element</a>. A Text node has no child nodes.  </p>
